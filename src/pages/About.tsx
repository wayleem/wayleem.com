        <h2 className="body mt-16">I'm currently a student at SBU</h2>
        <h2 className="body mt-8 w-[35%]">
          I am completing a B.S. degree in Technical Systems Management. I have
          taken several programming courses at SBU that had enriched my
          concurrent skillset in programing. I am autodidactive by nature as I
          love learning to use the latest, most prominent technologies, and
          frameworks. There are often cases where I feel that SBU didn't delve
          deeper into my interests, and thats where I go push myself to really
          chase after my dreams.
        </h2>
        <h2 className="body mt-8 w-[35%]">
          I love learning about proper practice. I would sometimes go back where
          I started to retrace my footsteps to really clean up bad habits, and
          pick up good ones. There are many experiences where I learned to be
          humble, and be the student to cultivate myself.
        </h2>
        <h2 className="body mt-8 w-[35%]">
          There are also times where I know I must take the lead. I have no
          problem showing initiative in areas that I am confident in, and areas
          that I am new to.
        </h2>
        <h2 className="body mt-8 w-[35%]">
          Given my experience, I have dealt with Front-End development and Game
          development. I am always open to go outside my comfort zone and pick
          up new experiences to broaden my horizons.
